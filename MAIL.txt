Support will send out email notifications when tickets are created and updated.
How these messages are sent depends on whether your Support clients are
integrated or not.  An integrated client allows users to reply to notifications
by email and thus to update tickets without even logging into your website.
A non-integrated client only sends email, it does not receive it.

For non-integrated clients, you can optionally configure the email address
where notifications come from at "Administer >> Support >> Settings" in
the "Default mail from address" field.  If you leave this field blank, Support
will get the email from your global Drupal site_mail setting.  If that is also
blank, it will take the default address defined by sendmail.

For integrated clients, you are required to enter a from address. When creating
a client at "Administer >> Support >> Clients >> Add client", you will need
to open the "Inbound email integration" fieldset and configure all the fields
contained within.  Inbound email integration requires that the client have a
dedicated email address for sending and receiving ticket notifications and
updates.  Each field is fully defined on the client administration page.

The Support module send out two different notification emails.  It sounds out
emails when new tickets are created, and emails when existing tickets are
updated.  The subject and body of these emails is defined in the
_support_mail_text() function in the support module.  There is no GUI to
modify the ticket text, however fortunately you can still modify this text
without directly editing the support module.

Each notification is broken into a subject and a body.  The default text for
notifications sent when tickets are created is as follows:

ticket_new_subject:
"!key !ticket_subject"

ticket_new_body:
"!update_username has created the ticket '!ticket_subject':\n!ticket_url\n\nState: !state\nPriority: !priority\n\n$reply:\n!update_url\n\nTicket text:\n------------------------------\n!ticket_body\n------------------------------\n\nUnsubscribe from this ticket:\n!unsubscribe_ticket\n\nUnsubscribe from all tickets:\n!unsubscribe_all"

The default text for notifications sent when tickets are updated is as follows:

ticket_comment_new_subject:
"!key !ticket_subject"

ticket_comment_new_body:
"!update_username has updated the ticket '!ticket_subject':\n!ticket_url\n\nState: !state\nPriority: !priority\n\n$reply:\n!update_url\n\nUpdate text:\n------------------------------\n!update\n------------------------------\n\nUnsubscribe from this ticket:\n!unsubscribe_ticket\n\nUnsubscribe from all tickets:\n!unsubscribe_all"

Any of these values can be modified by setting them in your settings.php Drupal
configuration file.  For example, to modify the subject for all notifications,
you could define the following lines in your settings.php:
$conf['support_mail_ticket_new_subject'] = '[My Website] !key !ticket_subject';
$conf['support_mail_ticket_comment_new_subject'] = '[My Website] !key !ticket_subject';

This modification appends "[My Website] " to the start of the subject of all
notifications.

To modify the notification bodies, you can set the support_mail_ticket_new_body
and support_mail_ticket_comment_new_body variables in your settings.php.

The various "!key" and "!ticket_subject" words are tokens which are
automatically replaced by the Support module when notifications are mailed
out.  All tokens are defined in the support_mail_tokens() functions in the
Support module.

Supported tokens:
 !username: the name of the user who is receiving the notification.
 !key: the [tkt:#] format key identifying the ticket.
 !update_username: the username of the user who created/updated the ticket.
 !update_realname: the real name of the user who created/updated the ticket if
                   defined, otherwise it will display the username.
